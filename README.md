# Exercise to display Wikipedia POIs in map

For Maas Global 


## Architecture

Chosed SwiftUI and Combine as I wanted to opportiny to learn those.  They are on early phases but looks once stabilized they will raise  iOS  development on new level. 

However I learned during this that those should not yet be used when yuo need interactive map with annotations. As there is no "native" SwiftUI support for those implementation is a bit hack, eventough according to Apple's guidelines. 

Chosed Apples own location tools, map and annotations, MKMapView, MKAnnotation.... One reason being wanted to learn those and recommendation was to use native Apple as much possible.  Personally I am not big fan of Apple Map and if this would real application with also Android app, I would go with Google Maps. 


##Requirements: 

Due to SwiftUi and Combine it takes Mac: Catalina  and Xcode 11.1 to run this.



###Shortcuts

Due the nature as exercise and some limitation on how much time can spend with these,  there is some shorcuts which would need to be properly implemented if real application.

-No localization

-Hardcoded a lot of sizes
